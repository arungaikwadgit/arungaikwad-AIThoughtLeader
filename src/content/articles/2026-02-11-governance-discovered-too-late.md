We were close to deploying an LLM/RAG feature when compliance asked for a bias/privacy review.

This is the **60–90 minute mini-audit** we now run:
1) Test 15–20 red-team prompts for bias/safety  
2) Inspect logging for PII capture  
3) Validate retention settings  
4) Document risks + mitigations in a simple register  
5) Schedule the next governance gate

The goal is not perfection. The goal is to avoid avoidable mistakes.
